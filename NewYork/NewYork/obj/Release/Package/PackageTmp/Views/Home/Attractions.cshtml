<h2>Attractions</h2>

<p>New York City's five boroughs are home to some of the world's most recognizable, cherished landmarks and attractions. From Times Square and Central Park to the Empire State Building and One World Observatory, the island of Manhattan packs more famous icons into one compact area than any other place on earth; and that's to say nothing of the City's four other boroughs—The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island—each of which contains its own roster of must-see destinations. With so much to see and do, we've rounded up the attractions that belong on any visitor's to-see list. To get a sense of the City's full breadth of activities, be sure to visit our complete list of tours and attractions for more ideas.</p>

<h4>NYC Skyline</h4>
<p>New York City's skyline is awe-inspiring. The skyscrapers, bridges, waterways, islands and monuments create a breathtaking panorama that is instantly recognizable worldwide. While you can feel the immensity of these surroundings from anywhere in the City, the grandeur of the cityscape is best viewed from above. One World Observatory is a lofty place to start. The observation decks, located on the top three floors of One World Trade Center, offer a stunning perspective on New York City—the sort of view that's only available from the tallest building in the western hemisphere. For many, no visit to NYC is complete without taking an elevator ride up 1,050 feet to the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building; New York City's second-tallest structure, this soaring art deco masterpiece offers a completely unobstructed, 360-degree view of the city below. For a spectacular vista that includes the Empire State Building itself, head up to the Top of the Rock, located on the 67th, 69th and 70th floors of 30 Rockefeller Plaza (home of NBC Studios). Note: One World Observatory, the Empire State Building and Top of the Rock are all open late, so don't miss the chance to see the City lights shimmer after dark.

<h4>Times Square</h4>
<p>Not sure where to look while walking through world-famous Times Square? Don't worry—you're not alone. With massive digital billboards whose bright lights make midnight look like midafternoon; star-studded Broadway and Off-Broadway shows (and reduced-price tickets to see them available from the TKTS Discount Booth); people peddling art and jewelry on the street; and, of course, the Naked Cowboy—who plays guitar in his tighty-whities—the expansive stretch of Midtown is a feast for all five senses. Visitors can shop in popular emporiums like The Disney Store, take pictures with wax celebrities at Madame Tussauds, watch the ball drop on New Year's Eve or grab a pre- or post-theater meal along Restaurant Row (West 46th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues), where many eateries offer prix-fixe deals. And with Broadway closed to cars from West 42nd to West 47th Streets, Times Square is now more pedestrian friendly than ever.</p>
